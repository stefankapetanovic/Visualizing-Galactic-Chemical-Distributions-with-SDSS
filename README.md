# Visualizing-Galactic-Chemical-Distributions-with-SDSS

Overview of Deliverables: 
- Our main code for our visualizations are stored in the "public" folder. Within this folder are our "js" folder and "css" folders.

The js folder includes the following:
galaxy.js
ptable.js	
scatterplot.js
script.js
The css folder includes the following:
style.css


Our index.html file is our main HTML, and the "bower_components" includes our d3 libraries that we have used. 
The bower_components folder includes the following:
d3-tip
d3


- Our "data" folder includes all our data sources which are required to run the visualizations. Below are the specific files required and used in our implementation. It also has one jpg of the milky way galaxy.
The data folder includes the following:
ApogeeToCSV.py
ApogeeToCSV_Old.py
ClusterData.csv	
data.csv
milky_way_anota_2000.jpg
ptable.csv

- Our "Notes" folder includes all of the static images we used throughout the project documentation. A full overview of the imagery is detailed in the process book .pdf file. These images were crucial to our data processing and they allowed us to understand how we needed to display our data to be aesthetic and informational.
The Notes folder includes the following:
